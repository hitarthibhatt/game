# game
This is a self-made "Stone Paper Scissor" game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game interface is designed with HTML and styled with CSS to provide a simple, user-friendly layout. JavaScript is used to implement the game logic, allowing players to choose between stone, paper, and scissors, and then comparing the player's choice with a random selection generated by the computer to determine the winner. The game provides immediate feedback on the result and updates the score accordingly. This project demonstrates my ability to create interactive and engaging web applications by combining front-end technologies.
